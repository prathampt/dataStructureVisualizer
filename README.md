**3D Data-Structure Visualizer** is a powerful tool designed to provide an interactive and engaging way to understand complex data structures. By creating 3D visualizations of various data structures, it helps users grasp their concepts more intuitively and deeply. This tool is especially useful for students, educators, and professionals looking to improve their understanding of data structures.

## Inspiration
Understanding data structures can be challenging, especially when trying to visualize their operations and transformations in real-time. Traditional 2D diagrams often fall short in conveying the dynamic nature of structures like graphs. Inspired by the need for a more immersive learning experience, the **3D Data-Structure Visualizer** was developed **in C**. It aims to bring data structures to life, making learning and teaching them more effective and enjoyable.

## Features
- **3D Visualization**: Provides real-time, interactive 3D visualizations of various data structures.
- **User Interaction**: Allows users to manipulate the data structures, such as inserting or deleting nodes, to see the changes dynamically.
- **Customizable**: Easily extendable to support additional data structures and custom visualizations.

## Available Data Structures
- **Binary Search Tree (BST)**: Visualize node insertion, deletion, and tree traversal.
- **AVL Tree**: Observe rotations and balancing operations.
- **Red-Black Tree**: Visualize the properties of red-black trees and their balancing operations.
- **Graphs**: Visualize the graph in an interactive way.

## Extensibility
The tool is designed with extensibility in mind. Developers can add support for new data structures by defining their properties and visual representations. This makes it a versatile tool for a wide range of educational and professional applications.

## Usage
1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/prathampt/dataStructureVisualizer
    cd dataStructureVisualizer
    ```

2. **Build and run the Project**:
    - Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed (OpenGL, GLUT, etc.).
    - Just run the followint command and everything will work for you.
      ```bash
      ./run.sh
      ```
